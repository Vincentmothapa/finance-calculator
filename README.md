# finance-calculator

This was Capstone Project 1 of level 1 of the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.

The project contains 2 calculators: an **investment** and a **bond** calculator. The user selects which calculator they would like to use and then input the necessary information for the calculation to be done.

### Bond Calculator

The user will be required to input:
* the amount of money that they are depositing
* interest rate as a percentage
* number of years
* compound or simple interest
This will output the value of the investment at the end of the investment period.

### Bond Calculator

The user will be required to input:
* the present value
* interest rate as a percentage
* number of months
This will output the monthly repayments.
